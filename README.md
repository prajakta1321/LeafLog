# LeafLog

 🎯 LeafLog is a City Sustainable Living Tracker that monitors how households contribute to eco-friendly practices. The dataset captures monthly household-level data on energy consumption, water usage, waste management, and green initiatives.

✅ This project starts with a city-level MySQL database (small-scale) and later scales to Google BigQuery for multi-city, large-scale sustainability analytics. 

✅ It provides a foundation to practice SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions) and extend into data analytics, dashboards, and predictive modeling.
