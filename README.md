# LeafLog

 ðŸŽ¯ LeafLog is a City Sustainable Living Tracker that monitors how households contribute to eco-friendly practices. The dataset captures monthly household-level data on energy consumption, water usage, waste management, and green initiatives.

âœ… This project starts with a city-level MySQL database (small-scale) and later scales to Google BigQuery for multi-city, large-scale sustainability analytics. 

âœ… It provides a foundation to practice SQL (DDL, DML, Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions) and extend into data analytics, dashboards, and predictive modeling.
